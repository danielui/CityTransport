 **Project description**
CityTransport is a script created to compare transport prices in city traffic. It compares prices in public transport and car travel. Times and distances are taken from "HERE WeGo" using "HERE Routing API" and "HERE Geocoding and Search API". Because of different ticket pricing in different cities, this script is usable only in Warsaw.
